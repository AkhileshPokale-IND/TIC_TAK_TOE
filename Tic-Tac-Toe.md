# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the fun game I made between the class as my class was getting to bored and non interesting. So to come out of my boredom I made the Tic-Tac-Toe to play with my friend.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players,X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid.The player who succeeds in placing three of their marksin a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game.
